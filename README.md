# Covenant Council

An AI-powered deliberative body for exploring the ethics of technology through the lens of the [Covenant of Humanistic Technologies](https://manifest.human.tech/manifesto).

This project was bootstrapped with [Firebase Studio](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio).

## What It Is

The Covenant Council is a Next.js web application that simulates a council of ten distinct AI agents. Each agent embodies a core principle from the Covenant of Humanistic Technologies. Users can submit "artifacts"—pieces of text, or images—to the Council for deliberation.

The application is designed to be a tool for thought and discussion. It provides a unique interface to engage with complex ethical questions about technology, innovation, and society.

### Core Features

*   **AI Agent Council:** Ten AI agents powered by Google's Gemini model via Genkit, each with a unique persona shaped by a guiding principle.
*   **Artifact Submission:** Users can submit text or images (under 10MB) for analysis.
*   **Multi-Faceted Analysis:** For each artifact, the Council provides:
    *   A **nuanced opinion** from each agent's perspective.
    *   **Positive (Utopian)** and **Negative (Dystopian)** analyses.
    *   An assessment of whether the artifact promotes **Acceleration or Decentralization**.
    *   An **Ethical Value Analysis** scoring the artifact on dimensions like Autonomy, Equity, Transparency, and Safety.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** The agents' collective alignment is displayed on a radar chart, with detailed opinions available in an expandable view.

## What It Intends to Be

This project is intended as a **deliberative tool** and a **creative medium** for exploring complex ideas. Its primary purpose is to:

*   **Provoke Thought:** Encourage users to think critically about the implications of new technologies and ideas.
*   **Facilitate Discussion:** Serve as a starting point for conversations about digital ethics and human-centric technology.
*   **Demonstrate AI Capabilities:** Showcase how modern AI can be used for nuanced, multi-perspective analysis beyond simple question-and-answer formats.

## What It Is Not

*   **It is not a definitive authority:** The opinions and scores generated by the AI agents are not absolute truths. They are the product of a language model interpreting a prompt and should be viewed as conversation starters, not final judgments.
*   **It is not a scientific tool:** While the analysis incorporates ethical frameworks, it is not a rigorous, academic measurement of an artifact's value or alignment.
*   **It is not a replacement for human judgment:** This tool is designed to augment and stimulate human thought, not replace it. The ultimate responsibility for ethical decision-making lies with individuals and society.

## Overall, is a functional software tool that makes the artifacts submitted on human.tech verifiable through the lens of the Covenant principles. It minimizes user friction

# It uses a council of 10 specialized AI agents to analyze any submission—text or image—against the 10 core principles. The output is a visual "Covenant Alignment Map" and detailed feedback from each agent, providing an instant, data-driven analysis of philosophical alignment.

# This tool operationalizes the Covenant for both curators and creators. It is a Tier 3 proposal designed to become a core part of the submission process, offering immediate, scalable feedback to the ecosystem.
