## Core Features:

- Artifact Submission: Allow users to submit ideas, text, and files via a chat interface.
- AI Agent Opinion Generation: Utilize the Gemini API to have 10 AI agents, each embodying one of the Covenant principles, analyze the submitted artifact and generate an opinion based on its principle.
- Principle Assessment: Have the AI agents assess to what extent the artifact aligns with their assigned principle, incorporating a tool to decide when/if this alignment information is relevant.
- D3.js Visualization: Represent the 10 AI agent opinions and their alignment scores visually using D3.js or other appropriate charting libraries.
- Chat Interface: Implement a chat interface for users to interact with the system and submit their artifacts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Accent color: Muted gold (#B8860B), analogous to indigo, for highlighting key elements and visualizations.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif font, for an elegant, intellectual feel.
- Use minimalist, symbolic icons to represent each of the Covenant principles in the visualizations and UI.
- Employ a clean and structured layout to present the AI agent opinions and visualizations in an easily digestible format.
